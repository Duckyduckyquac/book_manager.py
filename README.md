This is a simple python code that uses CSV files to manage a book list. 
It has the following features:
- Add a book(with Title, Author, and Rating)
- Delete a book
- View book/s
- Searching for a book by its title
- Clean missing data
- Sort the books by rating
- Initializes the program on its own.

To run:
1. Install Python(if not yet installed)
2. Install Pandas(if not yet installed)
3. Run the script:

What I learned:
- How to use pandas to read, write, and manipulate CSV files
- How to filter, clean, create, and sort DataFrames.

Notes:
- The file used for the code is 'test.csv'
- The rating should be from 1 to 5
